            <h3><img  src="pics/git-logo_bv0ydu.jpg" alt="git logo"/><br>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. In the first week we learned git to manage our future work projects. </h3>

Basicly, it's a social network for projects, which allows for version control. If you want to be visible as a web developer, github is the place to be. SO one of the first things we did in our training was to start a github account. Since then I am using github every day at work.</h3>

            <img  src="pics/HTML5_Logo_512.png" alt="html5 logo" /><br>In the second week of our training we started using HTML, which is the basic language of the web. It is the programming language you use to put content to a webpage. HTML 5 includes new tags that are used to structure your webpage and write semantic code. This way search engines like google have it easier to search the webpage for their content, visual impaired users that use screen readers have it easier to have an overview and coders can better maintain their code as it is more intuetiv what the code is doing. </h3>
